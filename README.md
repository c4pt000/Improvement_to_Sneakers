# Improvment_to_Sneakers

  Shoes or sneakers that can vibrate along the inseam of the bottom of the feet in the soles of the sneaker or shoe to notify the person wearing the sneakers or shoes of not missing critical calendar events paired via Bluetooth, and rechargeable via a QI wireless pad when the shoes / sneakers arenâ€™t being worn
	to also be helpful to the hearing impaired or completely deaf to avoid things going on around them such as volatile traffic or other hazards.
	Possibly also application for space for astronauts within range of other astronauts as a form of direct notification.
	
	
	thought of this  04-04-2021 as a real world improvement to sneakers after reading the news of "Lil Nas X - Satan Shoes, and the recent Joke of Lil Nas X giving God a lapdance from SNL"
